Learning AFNetworking
=====================

There are two separate Xcode 5 projects, plus some server code.

__AFDemo__

* simple three page app (list, detail, upload) with hard-coded dummy data and stubbed callbacks.

__AFDemo2__

* same simple app, but with fully working service layer powered by [AFNetworking 2.0](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking#20).

__server__

* the PHP server code -- super simple, and it works
